There are 5 mechasims in total:
 1) Swerve Animation- The swerve is incorporated for the robot 2(Reliable Robin), which has bewels meshed with the spur gears. 360 degrees rotatino is possible which provides. The rotation of the wheels and the                       direction of the wheels are controlled by different motors. It contains two motors one for steering and one for speed controlling.
 2) Hooded Shooter Animation- The hooded shooter is incorporated on the robot2, which is used to shoot the ball with precision. The shooting mechanism is used as the dribbling mechanism as well.
 3) Defence Mechanism- The defence mechanism includes wing like extensions which can be adjusted in 2 dimensions, in the Vertical and Horizontal directions, to gain maximum area coverage. It is a text-book like                         mechanism.
 4) Jumper Animation- The jumper is made using a prismatic linkage which has an exiension spring connecting the opposite joints of the linkage. The spring extends once the prismatic linkage gets compressed. The                       compression of spring, locking it in place until the jumping is necessary, and the unloading mechanism is incorporated in a single mechanism. A Ratchet Clutch mechanism is used to have the                       trasnsmission of the movement from the rotating shaft to the pulley. The pulley is mounted to the output gear of the ratchet clutch mechanism. The input to the gear is connected to a                             carbonfiber rod which gets direct power from the motor using a belt.
 5) End Effector Animation- The end effector is used to dunk the ball into the basket. It can fit the ball in it. It is used as the reveiving mechanism for the robot 1 (Risky Batman) before dunking.
 6) DriveTrain Animation- A lead screw mechanism is incorporated to absorb the shock produced after landing from the dunk. The drivetrain of the dunking robot has 2 wheels which are powered by the motor which                             are placed opposite to each other. There are castor wheels present perpendicular to the powered wheels.
