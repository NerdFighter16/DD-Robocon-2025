Please watch is robot demo video:

There are 5 mechasims animations in total:

    1) Robot 2 - Swerve Animation - 
        In 1st 5 seconds you can see the top and bottom bevels rotating with equal speed in opposite direction, so the wheel rotates and robot moves forward. In the next 5 seconds, the top and bottom bevels rotate with equal speed in same direction, so the robot changes direction.
    2) Robot 2 - Hooded Shooter Animation- 
        You can see the hood, which is used for shooting, passing, dribbling, change position using gears. The has 1 fixed section and 2 movable section. The green coloured section starts to move only when its magnets lock with the blue coloured section.
    3) Robot 2 - Defence Mechanism - 
        The defence mechanism includes wing like extensions which can be adjusted in 2 dimensions, in the Vertical and Horizontal directions, to gain maximum area coverage. It is also used in the catching phase of the dribbling action.

    4) Robot 1 - Jumper Animation - 
        The prismatic legs compress, using pulleys and strings, in the charging phase and "lock" in place using a spring loaded latch. The input torque from motor is passed though a ratchet clutch mechanism that prevents the leg from extending when not required. To jump, a small rotation is provided which makes the pink links detach from the yellow spoked wheel. Thus charging, latching, unlatching and jumping is all done using a single motor.
    5) Robot 1 - End Effector Animation - 
        In 1st 5 seconds, you can see the end effector opening and closing to catch the ball from Robot 2, next 5 seconds show the turret rotating and the end effector extending to dunk the ball.
    6) Robot 1 - DriveTrain Animation - 
        The wheels move up when the robot is landing to prevent damage. The fans suck air from underneath to increase downforce and traction on wheels.
